# Activity Feed

The Activity page shows a real-time stream of everything happening across your projects — task updates, milestone changes, appointments, and system events. It groups activity by date, highlights what's new since your last visit, and lets you navigate and act on items with keyboard shortcuts.

## Where to Find It

Click **Activity** in the sidebar. The badge next to the label shows how many new activities have arrived since your last visit.

## Understanding the Layout

### Date Groups

Activities are organized under date headers: **Today**, **Yesterday**, **This Week**, **Last Week**, or a specific date like **Feb 10**. This makes it easy to scan what happened when.

### Aggregated Cards

When the same person performs multiple similar actions in a row (for example, completing four tasks), the feed collapses them into a single card:

> **Sarah completed 4 tasks in Orga Development**

Click the card or the "Show 4 items" link to expand and see each individual activity.

### Unread Indicators

Activities that are new since your last visit have:
- A green left border
- A small green dot
- A slightly tinted background

These indicators disappear as you click on activities. When you leave the Activity page, all current activities are marked as read.

### Mark All as Read

Click the **Mark read** button (double-check icon) in the header to clear all unread indicators at once. This button only appears when there are unread activities.

## Filtering

### By Type

Use the filter pills at the top to show only specific activity types:
- **All** — everything
- **Tasks** — task updates
- **Milestones** — milestone changes
- **Projects** — project-level activity
- **Events** — appointment and calendar events
- **External** — external company activity

### By User

Type a name or email in the user search field to filter activities by a specific team member.

### By Project

Use the project dropdown to show only activities for a specific project.

### Show Archived

Check the **Show Archived** toggle to include activities you previously archived.

## Live Updates

When the Activity page is open, it checks for new activities every 15 seconds. When something new arrives, a green banner appears at the top:

> **3 new activities — Click to load**

Click the banner to load the new items into the feed and scroll to the top. Polling pauses automatically when you switch to another browser tab and resumes when you return.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Press **?** at any time to see the full list, or click the keyboard icon in the header.

| Key | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| **J** | Select the next activity |
| **K** | Select the previous activity |
| **Enter** | Open the Manager panel for the selected activity |
| **Esc** | Close the panel, or deselect |
| **P** | Pin or unpin the selected activity |
| **A** | Archive or unarchive the selected activity |
| **R** | Open the Manager panel and focus the comment input |
| **M** | Mark all activities as read |
| **?** | Show keyboard shortcuts help |

Shortcuts are disabled when you are typing in a text field, search box, or comment editor.

## Interacting with Activities

### Selecting an Activity

Click any activity card to select it. The card highlights and the Manager panel opens on the right.

### Manager Panel

The Manager panel shows details, comments, changes, notes, and actions for the selected activity. Use the **Manager** button in the header to toggle the panel open or closed.

### Rich Text Comments

Comment inputs across the Activity page and Manager panel support rich text formatting. Select text to see a formatting toolbar (bold, italic, links, etc.). Type `@` to mention a team member — a dropdown appears with matching users.

### Pinning

Pinned activities sort to the top of the feed. Pin an activity from the Manager panel or press **P** with the activity selected.

### Archiving

Archived activities are hidden from the default view. Archive from the Manager panel or press **A**. Check "Show Archived" in the filters to see them again.

## Tips

- **Use J/K to triage** — move through your feed with the keyboard, pressing P to pin important items and A to archive noise.
- **Check the sidebar badge** — a quick glance tells you if anything happened since your last visit.
- **Leave the page open** — the live banner keeps you informed without refreshing.
- **Use type filters** — if you only care about task changes, filter to Tasks to reduce noise.
- **Expand aggregated cards** — click to see exactly which items were changed when the feed shows "updated 4 tasks".
