# Rich Text Comments

Comment inputs across Orga support rich text formatting and @mentions, so you can write clear, well-formatted messages without switching to another tool.

## Where Rich Text Is Available

Rich text editing works everywhere you write comments:

- **Activity Feed** — inline comments on activity cards
- **Activity Manager** — the Discussion tab in the side panel
- **Task Manager** — the Discussion tab when viewing a task

The editor looks and behaves the same in all locations.

## Formatting Text

### Bubble Menu

Select any text in the comment editor to see a floating formatting toolbar:

```
"important deadline"
        ↓
  ┌──────────────┐
  │  B   I   🔗  │
  └──────────────┘
```

| Button | What It Does | Result |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **B** | Bold | **bold text** |
| **I** | Italic | *italic text* |
| **🔗** | Link | Wraps text in a clickable link |

The toolbar appears above or below your selection, depending on available space. It disappears when you click elsewhere.

### No Fixed Toolbar

There is no permanently visible toolbar — the editor stays minimal for quick comments. The bubble menu appears only when you select text, keeping the interface clean.

## @Mentions

Mention a team member to notify them about your comment:

1. Type `@` anywhere in the comment
2. Start typing a name or email
3. A dropdown appears with matching users
4. Click a name (or press Enter) to insert the mention

Mentioned users receive an in-app notification linking back to the comment.

### How Mentions Look

Mentions appear as highlighted text in the comment:

> The **quarterly report** needs @Thomas Weber's input before we finalize.

The mentioned name is displayed with a subtle background color so it stands out in the text.

## Submitting Comments

- Type your comment in the editor
- Click the **Send** button or press **Ctrl+Enter** (Cmd+Enter on Mac) to submit
- The editor validates that you've typed actual content — empty formatting (like just pressing Enter) won't submit

## Tips

- **Keep it simple.** Most comments don't need formatting. The bubble menu is there when you need emphasis, not for every message.
- **Use @mentions to get attention.** Instead of hoping someone reads your comment, mention them directly — they'll get a notification.
- **Links are clickable.** When you add a link via the bubble menu, readers can click it directly in the comment.
- **Rich text works in replies too.** Threaded replies support the same formatting and @mention features as top-level comments.
