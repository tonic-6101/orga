# Keyboard Shortcuts

Orga provides keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation and common actions. Shortcuts are available on the Activity page, Project pages, and the Gantt chart.

## Activity Feed

Press **?** on the Activity page to see the full list, or use the keyboard icon in the header.

| Key | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| **J** | Select the next activity |
| **K** | Select the previous activity |
| **Enter** | Open the Manager panel for the selected activity |
| **Esc** | Close the panel, or deselect the current activity |
| **P** | Pin or unpin the selected activity |
| **A** | Archive or unarchive the selected activity |
| **R** | Open the panel and jump to the comment input |
| **M** | Mark all activities as read |
| **?** | Show the keyboard shortcuts help |

### Navigating with J/K

Use **J** and **K** to move through your activity feed like a list:

1. Press **J** to select the first activity (or move to the next one)
2. Press **K** to move back up
3. Press **Enter** to open the Manager panel for details
4. Press **Esc** to close the panel and continue navigating

This works like keyboard navigation in Gmail or Linear — you can triage your feed without touching the mouse.

## Project View

| Key | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| **Shift+T** | Open the task creation dialog |
| **Shift+M** | Open the milestone creation dialog |

These use the Shift key to avoid conflicts when you're typing in search or filter fields.

## Gantt Chart

| Key | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| **E** | Start editing the selected task inline |
| **D** | Add a dependency to the selected task |
| **Tab** | Move to the next editable field |
| **Shift+Tab** | Move to the previous editable field |
| **Enter** | Save the current edit |
| **Esc** | Cancel the edit or close the panel |
| **Up / Down** | Navigate through the dependency chain |
| **Cmd+Z** (Mac) / **Ctrl+Z** (Windows) | Undo the last action |
| **Cmd+Shift+Z** (Mac) / **Ctrl+Shift+Z** (Windows) | Redo the last undone action |

### Undo and Redo

The Gantt chart supports undo and redo for editing actions. Made a mistake while dragging a task bar? Press **Cmd+Z** (or Ctrl+Z on Windows) to undo it.

## When Shortcuts Are Disabled

Shortcuts are automatically disabled when you're:

- Typing in a **text input** or **search field**
- Writing in a **comment editor** (including rich text)
- Focused on a **dropdown** or **select menu**

This prevents shortcuts from firing while you're typing. Once you click outside the input, shortcuts work again.

## Tips

- **Start with J/K on the Activity page.** It's the fastest way to go through your feed.
- **Use Shift+T from any project view** to quickly create a task without reaching for the "Add Task" button.
- **Undo on Gantt is your safety net.** Drag tasks and dependencies freely, knowing you can undo if something goes wrong.
- **The ? key is your cheatsheet.** Press it on the Activity page whenever you forget a shortcut.
