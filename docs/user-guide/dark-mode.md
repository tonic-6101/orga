# Dark Mode

Orga supports light and dark themes. You can choose to follow your operating system's preference automatically, or pick a theme manually.

## Choosing a Theme

1. Click your **user avatar** in the top-right corner to open the user menu
2. Find the **Theme** section
3. Click one of the three buttons:

| Button | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **System** | Matches your operating system. If your OS switches to dark mode at night, Orga follows along. |
| **Light** | Always uses the light theme, regardless of your OS setting. |
| **Dark** | Always uses the dark theme, regardless of your OS setting. |

Your choice is saved in your browser and applies immediately — no page reload needed.

## What Changes in Dark Mode

Every part of the interface adapts to dark mode:

- **Dashboard** — Dark backgrounds with adjusted stat card colors
- **Project views** — Kanban columns, List rows, and Gantt bars use darker tones while keeping status colors visible
- **Schedule calendar** — Dark calendar grid with readable event markers
- **Activity feed** — Dark cards with properly contrasted text and badges
- **Task Manager panel** — All tabs, inputs, and buttons adjust
- **Settings, Resources, Reports** — Fully themed
- **Sidebar and header** — Consistent dark styling
- **Modals and dropdowns** — Dark surfaces with appropriate borders
- **Scrollbars** — Custom dark scrollbar styling

## Tips

- **System mode is the default.** If you haven't changed anything, Orga already follows your OS preference.
- **No flash on page load.** Your theme preference is applied instantly when the page starts loading, so you won't see a brief flash of the wrong theme.
- **Per-browser setting.** Your theme choice is saved in your browser's local storage. If you use Orga on multiple devices, you'll need to set your preference on each one.
- **Keyboard and touch targets** remain the same size in both themes — nothing moves, only colors change.
